<p>
On your portal ensure you run as the Administrator. If "Agent Panel" is displayed, you are, in fact, running as the Admin. Otherwise, click on Admin Panel to see the Admin portal from which we are going to set up new configurations.

The new agents' list.

<p><h2>6. CONFIGURE NEW USERS (CUSTOMERS) </p></h2>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/racELsD.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New USERS configuration"/>
</p>
<p>
Switch to Agent Panel by clicking on it. 
</p>
<br />


<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lxX7CXC.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New users configuration"/>
</p>
<p>
I will create two users but you can create as many as you want. 
</p>
<br />


<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5iFr2GM.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New users configuration"/>

<p>
On the Agent Panel, go to Users > Add New User.

<p>
I created Teddy's profile and followed the same procedure with Suszy's. Then I click on "Add User".
</p>
<br />

<p><h2>7. CONFIGURE NEW SLA </p></h2>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/gUqOYzp.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New SLA configuration"/>
</p>
<p>
Back to the Admin Panel, go to Manage > SLA > Add SLA plan
</p>
<br />


<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jY4Ybid.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New SLA configuration"/>
</p>
<p>
I created 3 SLAs (SEV-A, SEV-B, SEV-C) with varying severity and deadlines to solving issues. SEV-A is considered the most pressent issues that may severely impact the business operations. Thus I set its SLA to 1 hour. 
</p>
<br />


<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IGKhC2K.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New SLA configuration"/>
</p>
<p>
I set SEV-B and SEV-C of decreasing importance and with a more generous SLA, as shown. 4 hours on a 24/7 schedule for SEV-B and 8 hours on business hours for SEV-C matters.
</p>
<br />


<p><h2>8. CONFIGURE HELP TOPICS </p></h2>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LiGTa8B.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New Help Topics configuration"/>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ddXJ1Fi.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New Help Topics configuration"/>
</p>
<p>
I named mine "Business Critical Outage" which is the most pressing issue. Name yours.
</p>
<br />


<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mnDqfpT.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New Help Topics configuration"/>
</p>
<p>
Click the "New Ticket Options" the tab next to the "Help Topic information" tab you've entered your help topic's name. Assign it a SLA group. Due to the severity of a business outage, I assigned it to SEV-A thus has 1 hour to be addressed and solved.
</p>
<br />


<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fGVORyP.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="New Help Topics configuration"/>

<p>
I also assigned this type of issue to a particular worker (here John).
